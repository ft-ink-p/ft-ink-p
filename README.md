## About me

I'm **Juan**, an engineering student currently in my first year of university.  
I’m learning programming from the ground up, focusing on logic, problem solving, and understanding how things work rather than just making them run.

I like working consistently, asking questions, and improving little by little. My goal is to build a strong technical base that will support me throughout my career.
